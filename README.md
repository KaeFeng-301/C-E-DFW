汉英模糊词辞典编撰实践研究——辞典包附件
This dictionary is provided in a digital .mdx format and is compatible with several major dictionary software platforms, including Eudic, MDict, GoldenDict, and EBWin. It is suitable for use in various contexts such as language learning, translation training, and terminology research.
To use the dictionary, please ensure that you have installed a compatible dictionary software. Taking MDict (PC version) as an example:
First install MDict from the official website. Then locate the installation folder, and place the .mdx file into the doc subfolder. Alternatively, open the MDict interface, go to Settings > Add Dictionary, and manually add the .mdx file.
To use the dictionary, type a fuzzy expression into the search bar. The dictionary will display a detailed entry including: english equivalents, fuzziness degrees (for both Chinese and English terms), example sentences in context (Chinese-English parallel), translation strategy notes and semantic analysis. And once loaded, a full list of headwords appears in the left-hand panel. Users can scroll through the entries and click on any word to view its full content. This is especially helpful for systematic review or thematic study.
If using Eudic or GoldenDict, users can enable the pop-up search feature. When reading online content or documents, simply highlight a Chinese fuzzy word and a pop-up window will show relevant translation suggestions, fuzziness indicators, and usage notes. This function offers a quick, convenient way to access fuzzy language support during reading or translation tasks.
